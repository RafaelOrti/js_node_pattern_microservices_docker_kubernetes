Welcome to the Microservices Application project! This repository demonstrates a microservices-based architecture for building and deploying a scalable and modular application. Each microservice handles a specific domain and communicates with others via well-defined APIs. The project showcases best practices, tools, and patterns for developing and managing microservices.

## Features

- Scalable microservices architecture
- Separation of concerns for better maintainability
- RESTful APIs for communication between services
- Shared libraries for common functionalities
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes and Helm for orchestration and deployment

## Services

The project consists of the following microservices:

1. Auth Service
2. User Service
3. Order Service
   <!-- Add more services as needed -->

Each service is organized with its own directory, containing source code, tests, and configuration.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microservices-app.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` in each service's directory
3. Set up environment variables: Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure as needed
4. Start services: Run `npm start` in each service's directory

## Configuration

Service-specific configuration is managed through environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` in each service's directory for required variables.

## Development

To contribute to this project, follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2. Implement your changes and write tests if applicable.
3. Ensure existing tests pass: `npm test` in each service's directory.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are included for each service using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Run tests with the `npm test` command in each service's directory.

## Deployment

This project supports deployment to Kubernetes using Helm charts. Refer to the `deployments` directory for deployment configurations and Helm charts for each service.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for bug fixes, improvements, or new features. Please follow the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
